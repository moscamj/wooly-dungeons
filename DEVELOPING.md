# Developing Wooly Dungeons

This file contains supplementary notes on how to extend the basic
scaffold.  Many of these points derive from the official Forge
documentation, which should be your primary reference【9580055740765†L147-L167】.

## Building and testing

* Run `./gradlew build` to compile the mod.  The resulting JAR will be
  placed under `build/libs`.  You can drop this file into a
  Forge‑enabled `mods` folder to play your mod outside of your IDE【9580055740765†L228-L236】.
* Use `./gradlew runClient` to launch a dev client or `./gradlew
  runServer` to launch a dev server.  Eclipse run configurations are
  generated by `genEclipseRuns`, but you can also invoke these tasks
  from the command line【9580055740765†L161-L167】.

## Registering content

Forge uses a series of registries to manage game content.  Items,
blocks, and other game objects should be registered via a
`DeferredRegister` bound to the mod event bus.  See
`ModItems.java` for an example.  Additional deferred registers can
be created for blocks, block entities, biomes, etc.

## Custom dimensions

Forge automatically loads custom dimension definitions from JSON
files located in `data/<modid>/dimension` and `dimension_type`.
Your mod must also define a `ResourceKey<Level>` and
`ResourceKey<DimensionType>` for each dimension so server code can
reference them.  These keys are declared in `WoolyDimensions.java`.

The example Lime realm uses the Overworld noise settings but
specifies its own dimension type.  You can customise the fog colour,
skybox, and worldgen by editing the JSON files.  Check the
Minecraft Wiki or the Forge docs for details on dimension JSON fields.

## Teleporting between dimensions

The `LimeKeystoneItem` demonstrates how to teleport a player
between dimensions.  On the server side, look up the destination
level via `ServerLevel dest = server.getLevel(targetKey)`, then call
`player.teleportTo(dest, x, y, z, yaw, pitch)` as shown in the
class.  Always choose a safe teleport destination to avoid placing
players in the void or inside blocks.

## Moving forward

This scaffold focuses on the very first story of your MVP.  To
continue toward a full featured mod you will need to:

* Define creative tabs and register blocks for portal frames.
* Create Jigsaw structure pools and attach them to the Lime realm.
* Implement a boss bar or scoreboard timer to limit runs.
* Drop a Lime Wool item on completion and implement a Monument block.

Each of these tasks builds on the concepts illustrated in this
project.  Consult the official documentation for additional APIs and
best practices【15952368173086†L120-L160】.
